AWS access key and secret key:
Do not define in a `variables_tf` file.  
Instead, define the two environment variables in the linux shell.
For example:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=`cat ~/.aws/git-terraform-ec2-user-k`
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`cat ~/.aws/git-terraform-ec2-user-s`

If I were to define the variables, this is what it would look like in the `variables_tf` file:

variable "aws_access_key" {
  description = "The AWS access key"
}
variable "aws_secret_key" {
  description = "The AWS secret key"
}




Still  to do:
Define a security group for the EC2 instance.
Out of the box, the security group does not give access.
